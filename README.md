> An app to manage tasks. A user can add, delete and edit a task and mark it as completed, It uses simple GUI and relies on DOM manipulation in pure JS and using local storage.

> In this project, I will build a simple HTML list of To Do tasks. The list will be styled according to the specifications listed later in this lesson. This simple web page will be built using webpack and served by a webpack dev server.
